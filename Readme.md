# Joki Developer Tool for Chrome (and ilk)

This tool can be used to help debug and develop web apps that use joki library.

This is a very early version with a lot missing and buggy features and errors popping up at the moment. Handle with care.

## Requirements

* The chrome browser must be set to developer mode and this tool added to it manually.

* Set Chrome to development mode 
  * Open chrome with url: chrome://extensions/ 
  * Check the development mode
* Add local extension
  * Click **Load unpacked**
  * Add the folder where the extension is located and add it
* Profit!
